# music-genre-classification
This project is part of my internship at **Elevvo Pathways**.   It classifies songs into genres using two approaches:    1. **Tabular-based** (using extracted features like MFCCs)   2. **Image-based CNN** (using spectrograms)   3. **Transfer Learning** (VGG16 on spectrograms)
